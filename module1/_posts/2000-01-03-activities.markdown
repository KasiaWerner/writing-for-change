# Activities
You’ll write a couple of short bio pieces this week and jot down a quick list of issues on your mind.
- What’s your bio?  (Don't just a cut and paste of your bio from work.)  Briefly share who you are, what you do, and what motivates you.  You might also share what challenges or frustrates you.
- What’s you creation myth?  What has shaped you?  Like Turkle and Auster, are there objects that are always with you or symbolize who you are in some way?
- What social issues are on your mind?
