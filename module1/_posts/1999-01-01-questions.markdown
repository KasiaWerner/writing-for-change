# Key Questions To Think About This Week

## What issues in the world around me am I connected to? 
## What are the problems that I engage with in my life that I want to tackle? 
## How do I write something that starts to move the needle in that direction?

This week's theme is about looking around your world and identifying which social issues you encounter in your day-to-day life. We'll ask you to do some freewriting about your own background to try and unpack which issues are important to you.
