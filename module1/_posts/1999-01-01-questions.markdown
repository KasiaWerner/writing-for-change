## The issue

This week's theme is about looking around your world and identifying which social issues you encounter in your day-to-day life. We'll ask you to do some freewriting about your own background to try and unpack which issues are important to you.

### Key Questions To Think About This Week

- What issues in the world around me am I connected to? 

- What are the problems that I engage with in my life that I want to tackle? 

- How do I write something that starts to move the needle in that direction?

### Head on Over to [Discourse](http://discourse.p2pu.org/category/writing-for-change) and Find Your Crew

- In Discourse, check out the ["How Do I Find My Group"](http://discourse.p2pu.org/t/how-do-i-find-my-group/54) thread, choose a subcategory of an issue that is important to you, and introduce yourself.
