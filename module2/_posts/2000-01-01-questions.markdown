## What is the Issue you Care About?
 
Your work last week brought you closer to clarifying a social issue that you are uniquely positioned to impact because of who you are and the things that drive you.
 
This week you will continue to explore how your issue plays out in the communities you engage with and explore what others are doing about it.   
 
The readings this week will encourage you to use the world as your classroom and to use writing to spur growth in your thinking.  Use Discourse to connect with peers you were introduced to last week—individuals like you who have chosen to influence change.  Share your thinking, your writing, and others will engage in the conversation.
 
Key Questions:

- Who has already started to answer, engage with, and solve this question?  In your own community?  In other areas?
- What are possible sources—in-person experts to talk with, and print and other media resources—to help your exploration of what has worked and what hasn’t?
- What are the key data points that drive you (and will drive others) to do the thing you want to do?
