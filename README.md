==================

A course where you'll team up with folks from P2PU and College Unbound ecosystem to identify your social problem, evaluate funding partners, draft your grant proposal, learn from others doing similarly-minded projects, and gain support within the social entrepreneurship community. Affinity groups (within Discourse, like so http://community.p2pu.org/categories) will be formed around subjects/social problems.
