# Activity 3: What Will Your Artifact or Intervention Be?

Now that you've read several stories of "how", it's time to spell out what your artifact will be.

Please post:
- A summary of describing your artifact and how you decided on that intervention
- A list of research links / articles (3-4) and the evidence that supports your intervention
- The names and backgrounds of a few experts who you will reach out and talk to
- A timeline for your project that ends the first week of November 2014

Don't forget to set your Google doc sharing to "everyone with the link" and manually add writing4change@p2pu.org.

Please post your proposal to [Discourse](http://discourse.p2pu.org/t/activity-3-what-will-your-artifact-be/253).
