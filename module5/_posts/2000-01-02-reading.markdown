## Focus on Your First 10
>People jumping straight into coworking calculating square footage & sizing up furniture, or obsessing over branding and their website, are skipping over the important and crucial step to developing a healthy community: *finding your first 10 coworkers*. Everything else can come after that.
 
>Where you find them will vary. What theyâ€™ll look like will vary. But these first 10 people are the human seeds of your coworking space to be. They will be the #1 reason that other people want to come work with you at your coworking space.
