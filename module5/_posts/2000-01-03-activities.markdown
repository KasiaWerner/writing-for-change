# Activities

1. Find someone from Writing for Change who has a similar idea to your project. 
2. Draft a series of questions about what brought you to this point in your inquiry and with your issue.
3. Craft an invitation to folks on the web for a public hangout and let Vanessa know--we'll use the P2PU platform to publicize it. 
4. Post a debrief of your hangout + sharing resources to Discourse under [Activity 5](http://discourse.p2pu.org/t/activity-5-find-your-crew-share-resources/300)
