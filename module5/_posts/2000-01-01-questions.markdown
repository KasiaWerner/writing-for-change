# How Do I Build a Community Around My Project?

Now that we've gone through the following processes:

- Identifying the issue that is closest to us
- Researching background information on the problem
- Looking at how others found their voices (and their pencils!)
- Giving valuable and thorough feedback 

...now it's time to build an audience around your project and connect to others. In this section we will answer:

- How do we invite others into the development of our project?
- How do we use the web to collaborate and find our wider crew?
- How do we document our collaboration on the web?
