Affinity groups (within Discourse, like so http://community.p2pu.org/categories) will be formed around subjects/social problems.","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nWe'll seed the affinity groups with sample projects to help people brainstorm ideas. Learners from other social innovation hubs will meet face-to-face but also find support through the wider \"Writing for Change\" ecosystem. Grant proposals would be written using the \"jigsaw\" method of creation, where individuals break off pieces and contribute to the whole in that way.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
