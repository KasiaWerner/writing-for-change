				<p>The goal of the course is to help you accomplish social change through op-eds, grants, applications and proposals. This course is for anyone who needs to write in order to accomplish social good in their communities. If you’re familiar with organizations like <a href="http://www.publicallies.org/site/c.liKUL3PNLvF/b.5106423/k.BD7E/Home.htm">Public Allies</a>, the <a href="http://nyc.socialinnovation.org/">Centre for Social Innovation</a>, <a href="https://www.summersearch.org/">Summer Search</a> or the <a href="https://wikimedia.org.uk/wiki/Open_Coalition">Open Coalition</a>--non-profits or social enterprises that have a passion to change the world--then this is your crew.
</p>
<p>As we said, the goal is to bring about social change in an area that is personally important to you. Each week will have a reading piece and a writing piece. We’ll start with your personal biography and establish why you care about this issue. </p>

<p>The P2PU social learning design will be an integral part of the course. Initially you’ll come together via the <a href="http://discourse.p2pu.org/category/writing-for-change">Discourse</a> community around the issue you are passionate about, then later you’ll work with folks who have a similar project to you. </p>

<p>
At the end of the course, you’ll have <i>a finished project that’s been polished by a crew of like-minded folks.</i> Featured writers include <a href="http://mirkwork.wordpress.com/">Sarah Mirk</a> of Bitch Media, <a href="http://annenberg.usc.edu/Faculty/Doctoral%20Students/Agloro_Alexandrina.aspx">Alexandrina Agloro</a> of the University of Southern California and more.
